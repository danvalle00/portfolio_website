                <h2>Complete C# Unity 2D Game Development</h2>
                <div class="section-divider"></div>
                <p>
                    I'm studying the Unity Engine and C# which is area I'm really want to be more proficient at.
                    The course I'm doing is the "Complete C# Unity 2D Game Development" on Udemy by GameDev.tv.
                </p>
                <div class="section-divider"></div>
                <h3>Section 1 - Intro & Setup</h3>
                <p>There isn't much to learn here, its just the setup of the Unity and its Editor</p>
                <div class="section-divider"></div>
                <h3>Section 2 - Delivery Dash project</h3>
                <p>
                    In this section I was introduced to the basics of Unity and C#, by making a 2D delivery car game
                    much of this I already know but
                    I decided to go through it anyway to refresh my memory.
                </p>
                <h4>Section 2 Notes</h4>
                <p>
                    A lot of things in this lessons was out-of-date but I choose to follow along updating the things,
                    like the Input System
                    And I feel it was a little weird the way sprites was handled, like the proportions and pixels per
                    unit.
                    It was the first project from this course that is supposed to teach to zero experience people, so I
                    understand why it was so basic.
                </p>

                <h3>Section 3 - Snow Surfer project</h3>
                <p>
                    In this section the goal was to make an surf runner game with power ups and logic to make flips and
                    increase the score.
                    Overall the content was very surface level but I learned some new things.
                </p>
                <h4>Section 3 Notes</h4>
                <p>
                    This section I learned about some new components such as: Sprite Shape, Surface Effector
                    And some concepts in UI such as: Layout Groups a little bit about anchors and pivots.
                    And I think it was basically it? I made some differents approach when compared to the teacher,
                    specifically on the code.
